Prehistory: I am a new student, that went from Intellingent Data Processing System 
to study Multimedia. Mrs. Karpowicz gave me extra time to complete all tasks I 
missed until 11/11/2020.

1. Click on the fork button (which is situated on the right top corner) and 
fork yourself to epg1_git.

2. You can do it in easy and hard ways: sometimes I create a special folder 
(usually calling GIT), open Powershell and write this command: 

PC C:\path> git clone <repository/fork_URL>

But this time i was a bit lazy, so I just opened Github on my Desktop, found my 
fork and cloned it to an appropriate folder.

3. After point 2 is done write:

PC C:\path> git checkout -b s18933 (in my case)

4. After point 3 is done write:

PC C:\path> git checkout s18933
PC C:\path> git fetch origin
PC C:\path> git rebase origin/rebase-me

These commands will also complete point 5.

5. I used this command in order to do fast forward:

PC C:\path> git merge --ff-only origin/rebase-me

But as I found out, commands in point 4 have already done all work.

6. After point 5 write:

PC C:\path> git megre origin/merge-me

However, I got the message about 1 conflicted file, so I went to Github on Desktop,
opened file in Visual Studio, removed all "<<<<<<>>>>>>" and "============" and 
finally pushed the button to complete the merging.
